      <h3>about me</h3>
      <img src="images/about.jpg" alt="">
      <p> I adhere to a disciplined schedule, waking up at 5:00 am and retiring at 9:00 pm. I value my time and strive not to squander it. Coding is my favorite course in school, and I make an effort to practice it daily. Singing, listening to music, and watching movies are my hobbies. I maintain a strong focus on my studies and future career. My aspiration is to become a in the future.
        <br>
      <br>I am a helpful individual, especially when it comes to assisting others with their studies. Humility and politeness are core values I uphold. I firmly believe that spreading love and kindness can make the world a better place. Describing oneself is a challenging task, but it is also intriguing. I believe our qualities, both positive and negative, shape our identity in the eyes of others. As Ebenezer Egyir, I possess a slender physique with beautiful dark skin. People may hold different opinions about my personality since perception varies from person to person, and that is acceptable.
        <br>

      <br>Therefore, I will describe myself based on my own perspective in various aspects. Currently, I am twenty-one years old. As an individual, I perceive life as an art form, and I am the artist of my own life. Regardless of the challenges that come my way, I strive to fill it with vibrant colors and maintain a cheerful disposition. I am an avid enthusiast, always fueled by curiosity. I yearn to unravel the mysteries of life and embrace what the future holds. Maintaining a smile on my face, irrespective of the circumstances, fuels my determination.
