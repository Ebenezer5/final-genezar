                  <p>I am Joel Hagan, a Snr IT Assistant at the Takoradi Technical University - Directorate of ICT.
                    I have know Eben for a while now and I am truly grateful for having crossed paths with such a
                    hardworking young man. Eben has been a great inspiration to me because his zeal to accomplish
                    what he sets his mind unto has clearly depicted his limitless potential to succeed in life.
                    As a young web developer, he has demonstrated his ability and passion by performing excellently
                    in his school projects and other extra curricular assignments. Moreover, his interpersonal skills
                    and sociable attitude is very impressive and due to this he is admired by all his lecturers and
                    colleagues.

                  <p>Ebenezer came back to his former institution from August, 2022 to October, 2022 for a compulsory and supervised industrial attachment as part of the fulfilment for the award of HND in Information Technology.
                    During that period in the school, he served in both the classroom and at the administration. He excelled in time management, self-motivation and problem-solving in both the classroom and administrative roles. As an in-service student, his communication skills with the students, staff and other guests were top notch. Even though Master Ebenezer Egyir is a physically challenged individual, it does not negatively impact on his work at all. He coaches and works tirelessly with or without supervision.
                    I therefore attest to that fact that Ebenezer Egyir would be a valuable asset to any organization he finds himself.

                    shows up earlier than asked, works hard, carries himself in a polite and respectable manner.
