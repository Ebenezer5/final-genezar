                  <p>I am Joel Hagan, a Snr IT Assistant at the Takoradi Technical University - Directorate of ICT.
                    I have know Eben for a while now and I am truly grateful for having crossed paths with such a
                    hardworking young man. Eben has been a great inspiration to me because his zeal to accomplish
                    what he sets his mind unto has clearly depicted his limitless potential to succeed in life.
                    As a young web developer, he has demonstrated his ability and passion by performing excellently
                    in his school projects and other extra curricular assignments. Moreover, his interpersonal skills
                    and sociable attitude is very impressive and due to this he is admired by all his lecturers and colleagues.
                  </p>

                <div class="testimonial">
                  <p>Ebenezer came back to his former institution from August, 2022 to October, 2022 for a compulsory and supervised industrial attachment as part of the fulfilment for the award of HND in Information Technology.
                    During that period in the school, he served in both the classroom and at the administration. He excelled in time management, self-motivation and problem-solving in both the classroom and administrative roles. As an in-service student, his communication skills with the students, staff and other guests were top notch. Even though Master Ebenezer Egyir is a physically challenged individual, it does not negatively impact on his work at all. He coaches and works tirelessly with or without supervision.
                    I therefore attest to that fact that Ebenezer Egyir would be a valuable asset to any organization he finds himself.
                   </p>

                <div class="testimonial">
                  <p>It was my great pleasure to personally worked with Egyir Ebenezer as an attachment 
                    personnel for one semester in Efutu Senior High Technical School.
                    During Egyir Ebenezers time in the school, I had an experienced with an individual who 
                    shows up earlier than asked, works hard, carries himself in a polite and respectable manner.
                    Your cooperation is anticipated.</p>

                  <p>
                  As a lecturer at Takoradi Technical University, I had the privilege of working closely with Ebenezer
                  Egyir during his academic journey. He has consistently demonstrated remarkable technical skills
                  and an unmatched dedication to his craft, particularly in web development. Ebenezer excelled in
                  coursework and projects, showcasing his ability to develop user-friendly, functional websites with
                  innovative features. <br>
                  What truly sets Ebenezer apart is his drive to learn and adapt. He regularly sought feedback on his
                  work and implemented improvements with enthusiasm. Despite his physical challenges, he never
                  allowed obstacles to deter his progress, always meeting deadlines and exceeding expectations.
                  His positive attitude and collaborative spirit made him a role model among his peers. <br>
                  I am confident that Ebenezer will thrive in any role or organization and bring significant value with
                  his expertise and dedication.
